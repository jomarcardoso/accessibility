# Understanding Web accessibility

With the evolution of the web, many features have been added, and the way to develop a website today is not the same as it was 10 years ago, much less when the web started. These many years of enhancement have made the web great but also hard to learn everything that has been present since its beginning in 1991.

This approach is fair, but at some point, developers must cover this content to become complete professionals. I hope that this article serves as a step back to understand web accessibility before following any rules to build your accessible websites.

It was common for me to interrupt the class when I was trying to understand something that my colleagues didn't realize they didn't know either, simply because they didn't need to deeply understand something to use it, especially in a test that would happen a few weeks later.
