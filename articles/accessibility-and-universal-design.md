One of the most common excuses from companies for not adopting accessibility in their products comes from the idea that it needs to be something made "especially" for people with disabilities, so for the industry, creating products for all types of audiences would be expensive. . Therefore, in 1987, the American Ronald Mace, an architect who used a wheelchair and an artificial respirator, created the terminology Universal Design, which defines that products must be designed so that they can be used by the greatest number of people possible, without need for adaptation or specialized design.

For example, environments that have access ramps, adapted bathrooms and drinking fountains, baby changing facilities, tactile floors, elevators with audio and Braille panels, etc. are in accordance with Universal Design. Another example is films that have audio description, subtitles and translation into LIBRAS.

Believing that making a specialized product for people with disabilities is something that solves "the problem", but creates several others, such as double maintenance, both for the product for "normal" people and for people with disabilities and the versions of the products differ, some become outdated or even left aside. Since its creation, a product made based on the concepts of Universal Design will not need to be made, adapted, reconstructed or even an alternative version for minorities.

The use of Universal Design means a big step towards an increasingly inclusive world, which adapts to people's different abilities and needs and requires less and less adaptive effort from them, and thus avoids the exclusion of individuals from participation. social and also the contribution that could be brought by these people, whether in culture or in the economy.

## Designing for everyone

The most relevant theoretical foundation for the concept of accessibility is Universal Design, which is the development of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design [4]. The main idea contained in Universal Design is that the designed world must adapt as best as possible to all people, instead of requiring a great effort to adapt from them. For example, environments that have access ramps, adapted bathrooms and drinking fountains, baby changing facilities, tactile floors, elevators with audio and Braille panels, etc. are in accordance with Universal Design. another example are films that have audio description, subtitles and translation into LIBRAS â€“ Brazilian Sign Language.

Thus, the use of Universal Design means a big step towards an increasingly inclusive world, which increasingly adapts to people's different abilities and needs and which requires less and less individual adaptive effort from them, which, as we know , always ends up excluding many people from participating in social life and also depriving society of the contribution that could be made by these people.

There are seven principles of Universal Design [12]:

Equal use possibilities: can be used by any user under equivalent conditions.
Flexibility of use: caters to a wide range of individuals, individual preferences and abilities.
Simple and intuitive use: easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills or concentration level.
Perceptible information: effectively provides the necessary information, whatever the existing environmental/physical conditions or the user's sensory capabilities.
Error tolerance: minimizes risks and negative consequences resulting from accidental or unintentional actions.
Minimal physical effort: can be used efficiently and comfortably, with minimal fatigue.
Dimension and space for use and interaction: adequate space and dimension for interaction, handling and use, regardless of the user's height, mobility or posture.
When applying the principles of Universal Design to the web, it is concluded that the objects and environments used on websites must be designed to be used, without modification or external assistance, by as many people as possible, regardless of their motor, visual, auditory, tactile or any other condition that may make it difficult to complete a task.

Objects and environments are transmitted on the Internet through codes, which must adapt to certain standards to allow both navigation controls and content to be compatible with the wide variety of web access devices, and with all the diversity of the Internet. assistive technology used by people with disabilities and reduced mobility. Therefore, all websites must be built according to standards, so that, when reused at scale, they do not pose access barriers for all or part of society [13].
